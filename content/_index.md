# Where the majority is on record.

## About
This is a prototype site.

The goal is to determine, if the 
citizenry of Sheridan County Wyoming
are willing to know and understand
the majority opinions, currently,
held by the population.

This site is, also, intended to
be a commons for developing improved
information services for our community.

This site is not intended as a final
product.

This site will change as the needs it's 
indended to address change.

This site is to be bare bones. 

Communication and collaboration are the focuses.
* Moto: less is more.
* Principle: Don't repeat yourself (DRY) - 
Once something is stated. 
Assign it an id. 
Then reference the id to add additional information.

Additional informatin can include:
* support
* reject
* edits
* comments

## Contribute & Collaborate
Currently the options are GitHub and email for communication.

As for what can be contributed:
* individually one can support or reject ideas being presented.
* Collaboratively groups can develop ideas to be reprinted.
  * This involves creating small groups to work in. 
    * Again GitHub and email can be employed for this purpose.


## Usage
* All topic are unique allowing indivduals to reference them. The topic is the reference id. 
  * GitHub
    * Thus supporting or rejecting an idea is as simple as assigning the reference id to your support or reject file.
      * A GitHub repository template can be view [here](https://github.com/wysheridan-xyz/wysheridan-account).
  * Email
    * Send the reference id, username, and stance (support or reject) in an email. 
      * Specifics on the email to send the information to is still being worked out.
* Collaboration is up to those involved though GitHub has tools to make the 
process easier. 
  * However there will be agreed upon criteria that must meet for 
a topic "idea" to be reprinted.
  * Criteria will include:
    * Formatting of the document
    * An inital number of supporters
      * For the county > 100
      * For a precinct > 10
      * Note the criteria is not fixed in stone. 
        * Eventually it should be decided by majority with respect to usefulness.
