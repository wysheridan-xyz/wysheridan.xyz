The intended audience is the Sheridan County Wyoming Citizenry.

The goal is to assist citizens in meaningful public communication.

## Precincts
By breaking down the County population into Precincts, it should be
easier to have meaningful discussion.

If needed the precincts can further be broken up into smaller subsets.

## Develoment 
- Citizens of any Sheridan County Precinct are invited to participate. 
- Decision and concensus building will be measured by vote, one person one vote, with the results being reported publicly back to the citizenry.   
- How topics and information will be added to each precincts webpage(s) will be decided by the participating citizens of each precinct.
- Email and GitHub are two options for Internet communication and collaboration of ideas.
- Initally this site will be one option for reporting to the citizenry of each precinct and the county as a whole.
