## Markdown Information

Below are some links on Markdown. A simple markup language for formating a document such as this README.md file. Note the .md at the end of the filename. Aditional markdown files (.md) can be added to the repository and then linked to each other as needed. Making a kind of local wiki.

### Markdown Links
- [Github Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [Github Markdown Wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

### Guides
As the project grows, discussion and examples of best practices regarding the use of markdown is encouraged. 

Caveat markdown is encorperated into the GitHub service. This is why the 
[https://github.com/ofbyfor/ofbyfor/blob/main/README.md?plain=1](https://github.com/ofbyfor/ofbyfor/blob/main/README.md?plain=1) 
file is rendered as it is on the 
[https://github.com/ofbyfor](https://github.com/ofbyfor) 
overview page. To see this compare the URL of this page with 
https://github.com/ofbyfor. They should be the same. 
Then take a look at 
[https://github.com/ofbyfor/ofbyfor/blob/main/README.md?plain=1](https://github.com/ofbyfor/ofbyfor/blob/main/README.md?plain=1). 
This is the code of the README.md that is being rendered. 

This is out of the box behavior for any account.

#### Example article
- Documenting the best practices for markdown, so new user can quickly get up to speed.

##### Oportunity

###### Notice
Seeking a small group of individual to work through the process using the website, GitHub and email. One of the objectives would be to, eventually, eliminate the need for email in the process. Yet initially the familiarity of most with email has real value in getting up and running sooner than later.
