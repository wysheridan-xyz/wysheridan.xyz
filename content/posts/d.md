# Beaver, Clint
Expertise: Law

## Question
With respect to persuasion how should the concept of advisarial be applied to public policy making by the citizenry?

## Statement for citizen consideration
Analogy to the citizenry being the managers of a team. All goalies is not the best strategy. A better strategy is to consider the best possible team rather than filling individual positions. That requires delibration and communication on the part of the citizenry.
