# Where the majority is on record.

## Intro
The goal is to determine, if the 
citizenry of Sheridan County Wyoming
is willing to know and understand
the majority opinions, currently,
held by the population.

In order to determine the 
majority the county 
population is broken up into 
voting districts and precincts. To
further easy the process the precinct
populations can also be broken up
into street and even block populations 
as needed.

The choice of strategy for building up
to a county majority from small local 
population voting tallies is to ensure a 
transparent process that any citizen
can verify for themselves. 

Success will be measured by accuracy of 
information and public confidence in the 
process.

## Proposal
### One Person One Vote
The options
* support
* reject
* or  ignore (default).

### Process
* Direct citizen input. 
* Sum the inputs. 
* Report back to the citizenry. 
* Repeat when necessary.

## Next step
Success could lead to a foundation 
for local information services to ensure an
informed & engaged county citizenry.

## Functioning Direct Democracy
Not as a form of government, yet
as a means for meaningful 
public communication.

## The Vision 
We the People collaboratively 
accomplishing the work of citizens 
(the work necessary to provide,
timely, 
civic leadership for our Republic
that derives its authority from
the governed). 

## A Mechanism
- A convenient option for reporting 
to the citizenry is a website. 
- A website provides a single online 
location for obtaining current 
availible information. 
- Furthermore
a website can be divided up into a 
collection of webpages allowing 
information to be organized by
the county as a whole or each 
precinct seperately. 
- Additionally
meta data, i.e. tags, keywords, 
can be used to link related
information. 
- Thus allowing for
the development of complex ideas.
- Finally email and Github can be used
for individuals, independently and
collaboratively, to input information
for the purpose of publicly reporting
it.

## In Summary
Rekindle Our County Spirit:

Of, By, & For is still an option.
