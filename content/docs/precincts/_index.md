# Introduction

In order to make collaboration between all of the citizenry of Sheridan County Wyoming possible.
An organizational strategy is needed. Since the county already has such a strategy in place
it will be used. The population is broken up into smaller groups based on geo administrative 
boundaries. In our case, the county, is divided into voting districts which are further divided
into voting precincts. Then further divisions could be made by street name.

For the purposes of this endevour the population need to be broken up into small size groups.
Not only do all of the members of a group need to know each other. They need to live in the same
area. The primary reason for this is to make verification possible. There are three forms of 
verification that are necessary. First is verification of an individual. Second is verification
of accuracy. Third is verification of trust.

The plan
* Join in.
* Share ideas.
* Take a public stances on the important stuff.
* Ensure accuracy and trust in the product and the process.
* Work towards an informed citizenry.
* Work towards measuring, knowing, & understanding the majority opinions of the county.
