## PREAMBLE

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
all men are created equal, that they are
endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights, that among these are
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
―Preamble to the Declaration of Independence

We the People of the United States, in Order
to form a more perfect Union, establish
Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide
for the common defense, promote the
general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of
Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do
ordain and establish this Constitution for
the United States of America.
―Preamble to the Constitution


Democrats will fight to repair the soul of this
nation. To unite and to heal our country. To
turn this crisis into a crucible, from which we
will forge a stronger, brighter, and more
equitable future.

We must right the wrongs in our
democracy, redress the systemic injustices
that have long plagued our society, throw
open the doors of opportunity for all
Americans, and reinvent our institutions at
home and our leadership abroad. We do not
simply aspire to return our country to where
we were four years ago. We know we must
be bolder and more ambitious.
―Democratic Party Platform 2020

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES

The Sheridan County Democratic Party seeks to
ensure that all people enjoy the unalienable rights of
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness guaranteed
by our U.S. Constitution. We are dedicated to ensuring
that every person—regardless of race, ethnicity, color,
religion, gender, sexual orientation, ability, and
political affiliation—has a voice in how we are
governed. We work for equality, domestic tranquility,
the common defense, the general welfare, and liberty.

Our democracy is facing a perilous moment in our
country’s history. As divisiveness increases,
communication and cooperation to collectively solve
major problems decreases. Sheridan Democrats
embrace civil discourse. We are passionate about the
pursuit of dialogue and solutions. We pledge to do
whatever it takes to build bridges across the growing
divide, to listen and try to understand all sides. The
most pressing priority we see today is to safeguard
democracy and to remain United We Stand.

We envision a Wyoming in which all people are
treated with respect and dignity. A state in which
every person has access to justice, housing,
healthcare, an adequate wage, quality public
education, arts and culture, public lands, a healthy
environment, and fair and free elections.

As Democrats—and more importantly, as citizens of
this state, nation, and world—we pledge to work
together to make this vision a reality now and in years
to come.

##                        SECTION 1: EQUALITY, CIVIL RIGHTS, AND JUSTICE
Sheridan County Democrats embrace the charge of our state and national constitutions:
that all humans are equal, and that this principle should be reflected in local, state, and

our society, where all individuals have the opportunity to live freely and pursue happiness.

    transparent process for addressing the improper use of force.

##                             SECTION 2: GOVERNMENT PRACTICES
Government in the United States of America is the collective will of the people in a
democratic society, working together to secure and improve the lives of all persons. All

##                             SECTION 5: EDUCATION, ARTS and CULTURE
“Liberty without Learning is always in peril and Learning without Liberty is always in vain.”
 ― John F. Kennedy

Sheridan County Democrats believe robust investment in a strong and diverse public
education system is essential for individual success and responsible citizenship. We
support Wyoming’s constitutional mandate that higher education be “as nearly free” as
possible.

    and/or trade school.

    develop local arts and humanities programs.

    and government studies, technology, mathematics, and formal sciences at all
    educational levels and institutions.

    enforcement of comprehensive anti-bullying and tolerance programs; we oppose
    arming any school employees.

    requiring student participation in any religious activity that places the burden of refusal
    on the student.

    the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and we oppose educational “gag
    orders” intended to prohibit, alter, or curtail such programs and curricula.

    oversight of academic curricula, and we oppose external efforts, including undue
    parental interference, to alter or constrain a teacher’s methods and lesson plans.

To achieve prosperity and enhance the health of our economy, Sheridan County

would stimulate the economy by increasing money in circulation used for purchasing
goods and services.

* We support the right of employees to organize and enter into collective bargaining.

    maintenance of supporting infrastructure (transportation, communication, and utilities),
    public services, and the recreational and cultural amenities that make our communities
    attractive places to live and do business.

    other educational and training opportunities.

Sheridan County Democrats recognize that we are global citizens and have a role to play
in promoting peace and prosperity across the globe. We must recognize and understand
the legitimate interests of other nations, their histories, and cultures, in the spirit of seeking
how to work collectively to resolve problems. We urge the same commitment to
democracy, self-determination, open government, civil and human rights, and the rule of law
